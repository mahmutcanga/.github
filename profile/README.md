### Hi there üëãüèº

I experienced how hard building a great team and a great product Customers love and want. I witnessed how hard building a category that can really change the world. Without a doubt, this fosters my product & engineering thinking in my daily contributions.

During my recent years, learning how to scale a SaaS Platform, building a great startup, finding awesome people to work and working with big retails in the UK and US were added as indispensable assets to my experience & knowledge. Moreover, I had a chance working at scale and building software for more than 100M monthly active users in meta search, marketplace and travel domains reaching more than 32 markets.

In addition, helping customers solve complex software engineering problems by extending software engineering and operational excellence practices, delivering robust and operationally ready software solutions using cloud native software development techniques at big scale financial software designs end to end strengthen my vision and capabilities at enterprise level.

I‚Äôm always keen to reflect all these hard gained experiences in my next role to the team via a mentor-mentor relationship with fellow engineers, designers, product managers, leaders and of course to the customers.

Currently, I‚Äôm a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft working in a global engineering organization that works directly with the largest companies and not-for-profits in the world to tackle their most significant technical challenges.
